# Why / What

Recipe Index is a standalone Astro dashboard for curated, source-linked recipe
collections. Its homepage compares 50 egg-free vegetarian recipes that each
publish at least 10 g protein per serving and at least 10 g protein per 100 kcal.
It favors practical food over shakes and does not provide medical advice.

# Dependencies

- Runtime: Astro 7 on Node.js for local development and static builds.
- Hosting: Cloudflare Pages project `veg-protein-food`, deployed by direct
  Wrangler upload.
- Data: a checked-in multi-publisher recipe collection with source-published
  serving macros, source links, key ingredients, and India-fit notes.
- Production dependencies: Astro only.
- Internal Fleet dependencies: none.
